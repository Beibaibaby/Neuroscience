# HB-Learning

> This repo has learnt a lot from [this repo](https://github.com/Adoni/word2vec_pytorch) and https://github.com/PengFoo/word2vec-pytorch

This repo implements the **SkipGram model with negative sampling** of Word2vec and **HB-learning** defined by Qihang Wu and Draco Xu.

To train the model:
`python train.py` 

To see the association in Word2vec-ed senmantic space：
`python test_embedding.py` 

To get the final output of our model, run 
`python godfather_net.py`
